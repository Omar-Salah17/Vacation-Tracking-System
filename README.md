# Vacation-Tracking-System
ðŸ§­ Vision 
In traditional workflows, vacation requests required multiple manual stepsâ€”submission, managerial approval, and HR processingâ€”often resulting in long delays. VTS automates this sequence by introducing a rules-based validation engine that enforces leave policies without manual intervention. The result is faster processing, improved accuracy, and reduced overhead for the HR department.
