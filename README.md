# Vacation-Tracking-System

## 🧭 Vision 

In traditional workflows, vacation requests required multiple manual steps—submission, managerial approval, and HR processing—often resulting in long delays. VTS automates this sequence by introducing a rules-based validation engine that enforces leave policies without manual intervention. The result is faster processing, improved accuracy, and reduced overhead for the HR department.

## ⚙️ Functional Requirements

🔄 **Automated Rule Validation** – Enforces company policies without requiring manual review.

✅ **Approval Workflow** – Supports flexible manager approval logic based on employee roles.

📆 **Request History & Future Planning** – View the previous year’s calendar history and submit leave requests for up to 18 months into the future, including the upcoming year and first half of the following year.

📬 **Email Notifications** – Keeps all parties informed with automatic email updates.

🔓 **Admin Overrides** – Admins/HR can override validation rules; all actions are logged.

🎖  **Manager Controls** – Managers can grant personal time off within policy limits.

🧪 **Vacation Summary API** – Provides a web service interface for internal systems to retrieve any employee’s vacation request summary for integration and reporting.

🏛  **HR System Connectivity** – Interfaces with legacy HR systems to fetch and synchronize employee data, ensuring consistency and accuracy across platforms.

## 🖥 Non-Functional Requirements

🧩 **Seamless Authentication Integration**  – Implemented as an extension of the existing intranet portal and leverages the portal’s single-sign-on (SSO) mechanisms for user authentication.

📝 **Audit Logs** – Tracks every change for transparency and compliance.

💡 **Usability** – Designed with a simple and intuitive interface suitable for all employees, regardless of technical skill.

🔁 **Availability & Reliability** – Ensures 99.9% uptime during business hours with robust failover mechanisms.

🔒 **Security** – Access is role-based and enforced using secure communication standards (e.g., HTTPS, encrypted sessions).

📈 **Scalability** – Capable of supporting increasing numbers of employees and data growth without affecting performance.

⚡ **Performance** – Response time for standard actions (e.g., viewing or submitting requests) should not exceed 2 seconds under normal load.

🧠 **Maintainability** – Developed using modular architecture to support easy updates, debugging, and system extensions.

## 🚧 System Constraints

🧩 **Portal Integration** – The system must be developed as an extension of the existing intranet portal. 

🖥 **Infrastructure Reuse** – The solution must use the current hardware and middleware infrastructure

🔐 **Authentication Consistency** – Authentication must use the portal’s existing Single Sign-On (SSO) mechanism.

🧾 **Logging Mandate** – All transactions and overrides must be logged for audit and compliance purposes.

 🏛 **HR System Compatibility** – The system must interface with the existing HR legacy systems to fetch and update employee data.

 ## 👥 Actors

 - **Employee** – Manages personal leave requests.

 - **Manager** – Approves requests, grants time off, and monitors their team’s activity.

 - **HR Clerk** – Maintains employee data and corrects records through a special interface.

 - **System Administrator** – Oversees technical operations and ensures system reliability.
