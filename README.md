# Vacation-Tracking-System

## 🧭 Vision 

In traditional workflows, vacation requests required multiple manual steps—submission, managerial approval, and HR processing—often resulting in long delays. VTS automates this sequence by introducing a rules-based validation engine that enforces leave policies without manual intervention. The result is faster processing, improved accuracy, and reduced overhead for the HR department.
